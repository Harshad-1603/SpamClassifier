Our Email Spam Classifier utilizes the power of the Naive Bayes algorithm. This intelligent system analyzes your emails, learning the tell-tale signs of spam.  Imagine it like a detective building a case.  Naive Bayes examines the probability of words and phrases commonly found in spam, like "free" or overly urgent language.  Using this knowledge, it assigns a "spam score" to new emails, filtering out unwanted promotions while ensuring important messages reach your inbox.  The result?  A clutter-free haven, saving you time and putting you back in control of your email!
